# Predictive-modeling Using RandomForest
Explore and prepare the dataset First, spend some time exploring the dataset in the. Then we consider how to prepare the dataset for a predictive model. We thought about any new features you want to create in order to make the model even better.

Train a machine learning model When the data is ready for modelling, we train a machine learning model to be able to predict the target outcome, which is a customer making a booking. For this task, we used an algorithm that easily allows us to output information about how each variable within the model contributes to its predictive power. Used RandomForest.

Evaluate model and present findings After training the model, we evaluate how well it performed by conducting cross-validation and outputting appropriate evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we create a visualisation to interpret how each variable contributed to the model. Finally, we summarised our findings in a single slide to be sent to a hypothetical manager using powerpoint.
